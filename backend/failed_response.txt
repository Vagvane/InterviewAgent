    {"category": "Subjective", "type": "subjective", "text": "Explain the concept of loose coupling in object-oriented programming and provide an example.", "options": [], "correct_answer": "Loose coupling refers to the degree to which two or more objects are independent of each other. In a loosely coupled system, changes to one object do not affect the other objects. An example of loose coupling is a payment gateway system, where the payment processor is independent of the order system. When the payment processor is updated, it does not affect the order system, and vice versa. This allows for easier maintenance and scalability of the system."}
